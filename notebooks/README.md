# MarkSix Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for various aspects of the MarkSix project.

## Directory Structure

### ðŸ“Š Analysis (`analysis/`)
- `1_Data_Analysis_and_Feature_Engineering.ipynb` - Comprehensive data exploration and feature analysis

### ðŸ§ª Experiments (`experiments/`)
- `2_Model_Training.ipynb` - Interactive model training and experimentation
- `3_Inference_and_Evaluation.ipynb` - Model evaluation and performance analysis

### ðŸ“š Tutorials (`tutorials/`)
- `4_Hyperparameter_Optimization_Demo.ipynb` - Guide to using the hyperparameter optimization system

## Getting Started

1. **Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   conda activate marksix_ai
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. **Dependencies**: All notebooks are designed to work with the main project environment. No additional requirements needed.

3. **Execution Order**: For new users, we recommend following this order:
   1. Analysis notebooks (understand the data)
   2. Tutorial notebooks (learn the system)
   3. Experiment notebooks (run experiments)

## Usage Notes

- All notebooks assume you're running from the project root directory
- Outputs have been cleared for clean repository state
- Make sure the marksix_ai conda environment is activated before running
- Each notebook includes its own dependencies and setup cells

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter import errors:
1. Ensure you're in the correct conda environment
2. Check that you're running jupyter from the project root
3. Verify that `src/` is in your Python path (handled automatically in notebooks)
