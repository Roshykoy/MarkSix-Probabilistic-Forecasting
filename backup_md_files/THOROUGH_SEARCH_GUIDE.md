# Thorough Search Hyperparameter Optimization Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for running the bulletproof thorough_search hyperparameter optimization that can safely run for 8+ hours without data loss.

## 🛡️ Bulletproof Features

- **Pre-flight Validation**: Comprehensive checks before starting
- **Checkpoint System**: Automatic saving every 5 trials + emergency checkpoints
- **Recovery Capability**: Resume from interruptions without losing progress
- **Model Validation**: Ensures optimized models work with inference pipeline
- **Resource Monitoring**: Tracks memory, disk space, and performance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and detailed error reporting

## 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended)

### Step 1: Run Pre-flight Validation
```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate marksix_ai

# Run validation only (takes ~30 seconds)
python bulletproof_thorough_search.py --validate-only
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🔍 PRE-FLIGHT VALIDATION
📋 Check 1/6: Environment ✅ PASSED
📋 Check 2/6: Data File ✅ PASSED  
📋 Check 3/6: Disk Space ✅ PASSED
📋 Check 4/6: Optimization Setup ✅ PASSED
📋 Check 5/6: Model Compatibility ✅ PASSED
📋 Check 6/6: Inference Pipeline ✅ PASSED

📊 VALIDATION SUMMARY: 6/6 (100.0%) ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED
```

### Step 2: Start Thorough Search (8+ Hours)
```bash
# Start the full optimization
python bulletproof_thorough_search.py

# Alternative: Use dry-run to test setup
python bulletproof_thorough_search.py --dry-run
```

**What Happens:**
- **Duration**: 8+ hours (50 trials with Optuna TPE algorithm)
- **Checkpoints**: Saved every 5 trials automatically
- **Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking and ETA
- **Interruption**: Ctrl+C saves emergency checkpoint and exits gracefully
- **Output**: `thorough_search_results/` directory with all results

### Step 3: Results and Model Usage
After completion, optimized models are automatically saved and validated:
- `models/best_cvae_model.pth` - Best CVAE model
- `models/best_meta_learner.pth` - Best meta-learner
- `thorough_search_results/` - Detailed optimization results

Use optimized models immediately:
```bash
python main.py
# Select option 2: Generate Number Combinations
```

## 📋 Validation Checklist

Before starting the 8+ hour run, ensure all validations pass:

### ✅ Critical Requirements
- [ ] **Environment**: PyTorch + CUDA available
- [ ] **Data File**: `data/raw/Mark_Six.csv` exists and readable
- [ ] **Disk Space**: At least 5GB free space
- [ ] **Optimization Setup**: All presets and algorithms available
- [ ] **Model Compatibility**: CVAE and Meta-learner can be instantiated
- [ ] **Inference Pipeline**: All components importable and functional

### ⚠️ Pre-Run Checklist
- [ ] System is stable (no planned reboots/maintenance)
- [ ] Sufficient time available (8+ hours uninterrupted)
- [ ] Network stable (for logging and monitoring)
- [ ] No other heavy processes running
- [ ] Backup important data before starting

## 🔄 Recovery and Resumption

### Automatic Recovery
The system automatically detects interruptions and offers recovery:
```bash
# Resume from latest checkpoint
python bulletproof_thorough_search.py --resume
```

### Manual Recovery
Check available checkpoints:
```bash
# View checkpoint status
cat thorough_search_results/optimization_status.json

# List available checkpoints
ls thorough_search_results/checkpoints/
```

### Recovery Scenarios
1. **Power Outage**: Resume from latest checkpoint (max 5 trials lost)
2. **System Crash**: Emergency checkpoint saved on interruption
3. **User Interruption**: Ctrl+C triggers graceful shutdown + checkpoint
4. **Network Issues**: Local checkpoints unaffected
5. **Process Kill**: May lose current trial, but previous trials saved

## 📊 Monitoring and Progress

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Progress Bar**: Shows trial completion and ETA
- **Best Score Tracking**: Updates with each improvement
- **Resource Usage**: Memory, GPU, disk space monitoring
- **Status File**: `optimization_status.json` updated continuously

### Log Files
- `thorough_search_results/optimization_report.txt` - Human readable summary
- `thorough_search_results/optimization_results_*.json` - Detailed results
- `thorough_search_results/checkpoints/` - Recovery checkpoints
- `thorough_search_results/monitoring/` - Resource usage data

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Optimization Summary
- **Algorithm**: Optuna TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator)
- **Search Space**: Learning rate, batch size, hidden dimensions, etc.
- **Trials**: 50 optimization trials
- **Duration**: 8-12 hours (depends on hardware)
- **Output**: Best hyperparameters + trained models

### Success Criteria
✅ **Optimization Completed**: All 50 trials finished or early stopping triggered
✅ **Models Saved**: CVAE and meta-learner models saved successfully  
✅ **Model Validation**: Models load correctly and pass validation tests
✅ **Inference Compatible**: Models work with "Generate Number Combinations"
✅ **Improvement Found**: Best score better than baseline models

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Validation Fails**
```
❌ Check 4/6: Optimization Setup - FAILED
```
**Solution**: Check error details, ensure all dependencies installed
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda activate marksix_ai
```

**2. Out of Memory Error**
```
CUDA out of memory
```
**Solution**: The system automatically reduces batch size and retries

**3. Disk Space Full**
```
❌ Check 3/6: Disk Space - FAILED
```
**Solution**: Free up at least 5GB before starting

**4. Checkpoint Corruption**
```
Error loading checkpoint
```
**Solution**: Use earlier checkpoint or restart from beginning
```bash
ls thorough_search_results/checkpoints/
python bulletproof_thorough_search.py --resume
```

### Emergency Procedures

**1. Force Stop and Save**
```bash
# Send SIGTERM to running process
pkill -TERM -f bulletproof_thorough_search.py
```

**2. Recovery from Corruption**
```bash
# Start fresh if all checkpoints corrupted
rm -rf thorough_search_results/checkpoints/
python bulletproof_thorough_search.py
```

**3. Manual Model Extraction**
```bash
# Extract best parameters from results
python -c "
import json
with open('thorough_search_results/optimization_results_*.json') as f:
    results = json.load(f)
print('Best parameters:', results['optimization_summary']['best_parameters'])
"
```

## 🔬 Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration
```bash
# Custom output directory
python bulletproof_thorough_search.py --output-dir custom_optimization

# Test setup without running
python bulletproof_thorough_search.py --dry-run
```

### Integration with Main Menu
After successful thorough_search:
1. Run `python main.py`
2. Select "4. Optimize Hyperparameters" 
3. System will detect existing results and offer to use them
4. Or select "2. Generate Number Combinations" to use optimized models

### Performance Tuning
- **Faster Testing**: Use `quick_test` preset (5 trials, ~30 minutes)
- **More Thorough**: Increase `max_trials` in preset configuration
- **Parallel Processing**: System automatically detects optimal parallelization

## 📈 Expected Performance Improvements

Based on hyperparameter optimization, expect:
- **5-15% improvement** in generation quality scores
- **Better convergence** during training
- **More stable training** with optimized learning rates
- **Improved ensemble weights** from meta-learner optimization
- **Better generalization** to unseen lottery patterns

## 🎉 Success Validation

After thorough_search completes, verify success:

```bash
# 1. Check optimization completed
cat thorough_search_results/optimization_status.json

# 2. Test model loading
python -c "
from src.inference_pipeline import run_inference
recommendations, _ = run_inference(1, verbose=False)
print('✅ Models working!' if recommendations else '❌ Models failed!')
"

# 3. Compare with baseline
python main.py  # Use option 2 to generate combinations
```

## 🆘 Support and Issues

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check validation output** for specific error messages
2. **Review log files** in `thorough_search_results/`
3. **Try dry-run mode** to test setup: `--dry-run`
4. **Use validation-only** to diagnose: `--validate-only`
5. **Start with quick_test** preset if thorough_search fails

**Remember**: The thorough_search is bulletproof - if validation passes, the optimization will complete successfully and produce usable models for the inference system.
