# Hyperparameter Optimization Debug Issues Fixed

## 🎯 **Critical Issues Resolved**

The hyperparameter optimization system had multiple runtime errors preventing successful execution:

1. **'torch.device' object is not subscriptable** 
2. **Input y contains infinity or a value too large for dtype('float64')**
3. **name 'np' is not defined**

All issues have been **completely resolved** with comprehensive fixes.

## 🔧 **Root Causes & Fixes**

### **1. Missing NumPy Import** ❌ → ✅

**Problem**: `src/optimization/main.py` was using `np.std()` and `np.mean()` without importing numpy

**Error**:
```
[17:07:44] ERROR - main.run_optimization:143 - Optimization failed: name 'np' is not defined
```

**Fix**: Added missing import
```python
# Added to src/optimization/main.py
import numpy as np
```

### **2. Device Object Subscripting Error** ❌ → ✅

**Problem**: `CVAELossComputer` was trying to access `config['device']` where device was already a `torch.device` object

**Error**:
```
[17:05:54] ERROR - Training failed: 'torch.device' object is not subscriptable
```

**Fix**: Enhanced device handling in `src/cvae_engine.py`
```python
# Before (Broken)
self.device = config['device']

# After (Fixed)
device = config['device']
if isinstance(device, torch.device):
    self.device = device
else:
    self.device = torch.device(device)
```

### **3. Infinite Loss Values** ❌ → ✅

**Problem**: Training occasionally produced NaN or infinite loss values, which propagated through the optimization causing GP model failures

**Error**:
```
[17:05:55] WARNING - Failed to update GP model: Input y contains infinity or a value too large for dtype('float64')
```

**Fix**: Added comprehensive loss validation in `src/optimization/integration.py`

#### **A. Training Loop Validation**:
```python
# Check for invalid training loss
if not np.isfinite(train_loss) or np.isnan(train_loss):
    logger.warning(f"Invalid training loss: {train_loss}, stopping training")
    break

# Check for invalid validation loss  
if not np.isfinite(val_loss) or np.isnan(val_loss):
    logger.warning(f"Invalid validation loss: {val_loss}, stopping training")
    break
```

#### **B. Score Calculation Protection**:
```python
# Return negative validation loss as score (higher is better)
if np.isfinite(best_val_loss) and not np.isnan(best_val_loss):
    score = -best_val_loss
    # Clamp extremely large scores to prevent overflow
    score = max(score, -1e6)
else:
    logger.warning(f"Invalid best validation loss: {best_val_loss}, returning minimum score")
    score = -1e6
```
