# MarkSix AI: A Probabilistic Forecasting System

This project implements a sophisticated, multi-stage pipeline to analyze historical Mark Six lottery data and generate probabilistically-informed number combinations. It leverages a **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)** with graph neural networks, temporal context modeling, meta-learning, and **automated hyperparameter optimization** to identify high-scoring number sets through advanced generative modeling.

## Project Overview

The core of the system is a **CVAE-based Generative Model** that learns complex latent representations of lottery number patterns. Combined with graph neural networks for number relationships, LSTM-based temporal modeling, and meta-learning for ensemble optimization, the system generates probabilistically-informed number combinations. This is not a guarantee of winning, but rather a sophisticated probabilistic measure based on multi-dimensional patterns learned from historical data.

The project is structured as a command-line application with seven main functionalities:
1.  **Train:** Trains the CVAE-based generative model with graph neural networks and temporal context on historical data.
2.  **Generate:** Uses the trained CVAE and meta-learned ensemble to generate high-quality number combinations.
3.  **Evaluate:** Measures the performance of the trained model against a validation set of historical data.
4.  **Optimize:** Automatically finds the best hyperparameters for optimal model performance.
5.  **System Info:** Displays current system configuration and model status.
6.  **Advanced Options:** Configuration management, diagnostics, and file operations.
7.  **Exit:** Graceful application termination.
